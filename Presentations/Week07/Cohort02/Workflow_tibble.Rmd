## Setup and Workflow
Your workflow refers to the series of good habits you get into in your coding process, that help save you time and headache down the road.

* saving code - not workspace , is incredibly important because it is an absolute requirement for reproducibility.

## Always start R with a blank slate

<font size="6">
* When quit R, do not save the workspace to an .RData. 
* When you launch, do not reload the workspace from an .RData file.
* In R studio, set this via _tools > global options_

<span style="color:red">usethis::use_blank_slate()</span> 
*     prints a reminder how to do this.

## R studio projects 
* Always put all the files related to a single project in designated folder.

* When working on different projects e.g, A and B, make sure the working directories are set to the respective folders where project A and B are saved.

In R studio we can make a new project by clicking File -> New Project and 
then choosing a name and subdirectory where we want to save the project.

* If you have project A and project B, you can work on it simultaneously by opening its own R process, with working directory set appropriately.

* Switch between multiple instances of R projects using cmd+Tab (Mac OS) or ALT + Tab (Windows.)

## Tibbles with tibble

* **Tibbles** are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviour to make life a little easier.

* tibble package is part of the _tidyverse_ .


---

### Creating tibble 
```{r echo=T, include = F}
library(tidyverse)

```

*  Most other R packages use regular data frame, so we have to coerce a data frame to a tibble.
```{r}
as_tibble(iris)
```
---
## Creating a new tibble 
* To create a new tibble from individual vectors with tibble()
```{r}
tibble(
  x = 1:5,
  y = 1,
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
```

---
* tibbles doesn't convert strings to factors, 
* never changes the name of variables and 
* never creates row names.

Also, with tibbles you can have column names they are not valid R variables names,i.e. _nonsyntactic_ names.
For example, they might not start with a letter, or contain unusual characters like a space.
* we need to surround these nonsyntactic names with backticks.
```{r}
tb <- tibble(
  `:)` = "smile",
  ` ` = "space",
  `2000` = "number"
)
tb
```

---
## Tribble()
* Transposed tibble is customised for data entry in code: columns headings are defined with a ~ before them, and entries are separated by commas.
```{r}
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  "a", 2,3.6,
  "b",1, 8.5
)
```
* This makes it possible to lay out small data in easy to read format.
---

## Tibbles vs data.frame
Two main differences
* **printing** : refined print methods that shows only the first 10 rows, and all columns that fit on the available screen.

* It reports each column's type under its name.
```{r}
as.tibble(iris)
```


---

* Sometimes, we need more output than the default display.
* We can explicitly print() the data frame and control the number of rows (n) and width of the display
```{r}
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  print(n = 5, width = Inf)
```

---

## Subsetting
* To pull out a single variable, we can use $ and [[.
* [[ can extract by name or position; $ only extract by name.
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(5),
  y = rnorm(5)
)
# Extract by name 
df$x
df[["x"]]
```

---

## Extract by position
```{r}
# Extract by position 
df[[1]]
```

* To use these in a pipe, we'll need special placeholder . :
```{r}
df %>% .$x

df %>% .[["x"]]
```

Tibbles are more strict: they never do partial matching, and generate a warning if the column you are trying to access does not exist.
---

Q : 2 : Answer
```{r}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x
df[, "xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]

```

---

```{r}
tbl <- as_tibble(df)
tbl$x
tbl[, "xyz"]

tbl[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

---

Q : If you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g. var <- "mpg", how can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?
```{r}
df <- mtcars

var <- "mpg"

df[[var]]

df$var
```

* You can use the double bracket, like df[[var]]. You cannot use the dollar sign, because df$var would look for a column named var.
